\begin{abstract}
	\textit{We compare two bicycle models derived from first principles to a set
	of empirically derived models. The empirical models were developed with
	structured state space system identification techniques. The data was
	collected during a series of experiments on a gymnasium floor and a large
	treadmill. During the experiments, three rigidified bicycle riders manually
	controlled the bicycle through steering control for two tasks: heading
	tracking and lateral deviation tracking. Both tasks where performed with and
	without measured lateral pulsive perturbations. The bicycle was instrumented
	to accurately measure the all of the essential kinematics and kinetics
	involved. The resulting rider control actions excited the system across a
	bandwidth adequate for identifying the linear dynamics of the system. The
	resulting models are compared with several archetypal first principle models
	showing that the simplest bicycle models are not necessarily sufficient for
	capturing the fundamental dynamics of the vehicle. The roll acceleration
	equation was found to be reasonably predicted by the simpler first principle
	bicycle models, but the steer acceleration equation was not. A model which
	includes the inertial effects of the riderâ€™s arms, which more closely model
	reality, improved the model predictions, but still lacked full fidelity. We
	conclude the paper by exploring the validity of several of the modeling
	assumptions and potential sources for the prediction error.}

\section*{INTRODUCTION}
There is a rich history of bicycle and motorcycle mathematical model
development. This has been able to explain many of the more dynamically
fascinating phenomena from countersteering and stability to speedman's wobble
and gyroscopic effects (see \cite{Limebeer2006, Meijaard2007} for historical
overviews). But the amount of experimental validation of these idealized models
pales in comparison with the motorcycle experimentation outdistancing
that done with bicycles.

The earliest comprehensive bicycle model validation began at CALSPAN in the
late 60's \cite{Roland1971}. This included several revolutionary studies, in
one of which they made use of a rocket to apply know step torques to an
uncontrolled riderless bicycle. In another, simulations of slalom maneuvers
were visually compared with video footage. Very little work on the topic was
done until more recently. Kooijman \cite{Kooijman2006, Kooijman2009} made use
of an uncontrolled riderless bicycle's stability and excited the weave mode
showing good agreement with the eigenvalues of the linearized Whipple model
\cite{Whipple1899}. Lastly, on the theoretical side, Chen and Doa
\cite{Chen2010} make use of a structured black box identification of simulated
noisy data and were able to basically reproduce the eigenvalues of a Whipple
model.

In terms of motorcycle model validation, David Eaton's dissertation work in
particular stands out. He identified a motorcycle using both spectral and basic
regression techniques in his 1973 dissertation \cite{Eaton1973}. He conducted
experiments with an uncontrolled motorcycle with rigidified rider and excited
the system by tapping the handlebars and releasing weights for a change in roll
torque. He showed good prediction of the weave and capsize modes.  He was also
able to estimate the frequency response of the motorcycle model from the
spectral content of the measured steer torque and roll angle while the
motorcycle was manually controlled. Eaton's methods in many ways laid the
groundwork for many subsequent studies by other researchers, including this
one.

Stephen James \cite{James2002} identified an off-road motorcycle which was
manually excited by the rider by using black box ARX methods. He compared the
experimental results with a first principles motorcycle model he developed and
claimed good agreement based on visual interpretation of the root locus plots.
Biral et al. \cite{Biral2003} constructed empirical Bode plots of a motorcycle
under manual control from steer torque and kinematic data during a series of
slalom tests. They were able to get very good agreement with their motorcycle
model. Doria et al. \cite{Doria2012} excited the weave mode of a motorcycle at
high speed with a handlebar tap by the rider and was able to show agreement
with their predictions through a phase portrait view.

Basic bicycle and motorcycle identification is typically done on data collected
by exciting the vehicle through either perturbations in roll or steer. These
experiments can be done when the bicycle is under closed loop control or when
the bicycle is stable, the former being a requirement for speeds outside of the
stable speed range. But, the mode excitation methods are limited to the
frequency band around that mode of motion. Manual excitation under closed loop
control gives better excitation bandwidth and a pairing with modern system
identification techniques can provide richer models.
%
\section*{MEASUREMENTS}
We constructed an instrumented bicycle with a wide variety of kinematic and
kinetic sensors. The rider's torso was rigidified with respect to the bicycle
frame with the use of a torso cast. The rider's legs were fixed to the frame
with magnetic knee straps and an electric motor provided steady propulsion
obviating the need to pedal. The rider's head and arms were able to move, the
latter for steering control. Great care was taken to measure steer torque as
accurately as possible. We used a 17 N-m single axis torque sensor mounted so
that it only measured a pure torque about the steer axis. Steer and roll angles
were measured with potentiometers, the later through the roll rotation of a
lightweight trailer. Angular rates of the bicycle frame and the acceleration of
a point on the frame were measured with an inertial measurement unit. The body
fixed rate of the front frame about the steer axis direction was measured with
a rate gyro. Lateral perturbations were delivered by a push/pull rod with a 450
N load cell.

Raw voltage signals were collected on-board via a data acquisition unit and a
netbook laptop with a Matlab interface. A processing program was developed to
create and manage an HDF5 database of all of the signal data (700+ runs) and
accompanying metadata for each run. The software allows for easy querying,
converts raw voltage signals to the properly scaled engineering units, computes
the desired quantities for model comparison, and filters and truncates the
signals depending on the task for selecting the best data for identification
purposes. The black line in Figure \ref{fig:exampleFit} shows an example of the
processed experimental data for one run.

	Hz low pass Butterworth filter and means were subtracted. The remaining four
	graphs show the simulation results for the Whipple model (W), Whipple model
	with arm inertial effects (A), and the identified model (I) for that run
	plotted with the measured data (M). The percentages give the percent of

\section*{EXPERIMENTS}
We collected data with three riders of similar age, stature, and proficiency in
bicycling for a series of experiments. The data presented herein focuses on
two tasks:
\begin{description}
	\item[Heading Tracking]
		The rider was instructed to simply balance the bicycle and keep a
		relatively constant heading while focusing their vision at a point in the
		far distance.
	\item[Lateral Deviation Tracking]
		The rider was instructed to focus on a straight line that was marked on the
		ground and to attempt to keep the front wheel on the line.
\end{description}

Both tasks were performed with and without the application of a manually
applied lateral perturbation force just below the seat. The forces were applied
randomly in direction and time.

We performed the experiments on a treadmill and in a large gymnasium. The
treadmill is 1 meter wide by 5 meters long and has a speed range from 0.5 m/s
to 17 m/s. The treadmill was narrow but after some practice we were able to
successfully perform the lateral perturbations experiments. This provided a
very controlled environment, in particular with respect to constant speeds, and
allowed for very long run durations within a broad speed range. The gymnasium
floor provided a rectangular wind-free space of about 30 m by 55 m. We rode
around the perimeter to build up speed and did our maneuvers on a straight
section about 30 m long. We were not able to travel at speeds higher than about
7 m/s due to the tires slipping in the final turn into the test section.
%
\section*{FIRST PRINCIPLE MODELS}
Passive dynamics of the bicycle-rider system can be described with many models.
The benchmarked \cite{Meijaard2007,Basu-Mandal2007} Whipple model
\cite{Whipple1899} provides a somewhat minimalistic model capable of capturing
the essential dynamics. We use this model as the standard base model, as the
fidelity of simpler models are generally not adequate. The model is 4th order
with roll angle, steer angle, roll rate and steer rate as states and typically
roll and steer torque as inputs. We neglect roll torque input and in its place
extend the model to include a lateral force acting at a point on the frame to
provide a new input, accurately modelling lateral perturbations. A second model
adds inertial effects of the rider's arms because during the experiments the
riders were free to move their arms with the front frame of the bicycle. This
model is similar in fashion to the upright rider in \cite{Schwab2012}, but with
slightly different joint definitions.  Constraints are chosen so that no
additional degrees of freedom are added, keeping the system both tractable and
comparable to the benchmarked Whipple model.

We determine the linear model coefficients using measured parameters of the
bicycle and rider. The bicycle was measured as described in \cite{Moore2010} to
get accurate estimates of the parameters used in the benchmark bicycle.  Each
rider's inertial properties were estimated using Yeadon's method
\cite{Yeadon1990a} which allowed easy extraction of body segment parameters for
more complicated rider biomechanic models such as the inclusion of moving arms
as described above. The parameter computation is handled with two custom open
source software packages \cite{Moore2011a,Dembia2011}.
%
\section*{MODEL IDENTIFICATION}
Each run provided a collection of time series that describe the various inputs
and outputs of the system. For this analysis, we limit inputs to steer torque
and lateral force and outputs to roll angle, steer angle, roll rate and steer
rate. The ideal fourth order system is described with the following continuous
state space description
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\dot{x}(t) & =
		\mathbf{F}x(t) + \mathbf{G}u(t)\\
		\begin{bmatrix}
			\dot{\phi} \\
			\dot{\delta} \\
			\ddot{\phi} \\
			\ddot{\delta}
		\end{bmatrix}
		& =
		\begin{bmatrix}
			0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
			0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
			a_{\ddot{\phi}\phi} & a_{\ddot{\phi}\delta} &
			a_{\ddot{\phi}\dot{\phi}} & a_{\ddot{\phi}\dot{\delta}}\\
			a_{\ddot{\delta}\phi} & a_{\ddot{\delta}\delta} &
			a_{\ddot{\delta}\dot{\phi}} & a_{\ddot{\delta}\dot{\delta}}
		\end{bmatrix}
		\begin{bmatrix}
			\phi \\
			\delta \\
			\dot{\phi} \\
			\dot{\delta}
		\end{bmatrix}
		+
		\begin{bmatrix}
			0 & 0 \\
			0 & 0\\
			b_{\ddot{\phi}T_\delta} & b_{\ddot{\phi}F_{c_l}}\\
			b_{\ddot{\delta}T_\delta} & b_{\ddot{\delta}F_{c_l}}
		\end{bmatrix}
		\begin{bmatrix}
			T_\delta\\
			F_{c_l}
		\end{bmatrix}\\
		\eta(t) & = \mathbf{H}x(t)\\
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{H}$ is the identity matrix.

Assuming that this model structure adequately captures the dynamics of
interest of the bicycle-rider system, our goal is to accurately identify the
unknown parameters $\theta$ which are made up of the unspecified entries in the
$\mathbf{F}$ and $\mathbf{G}$ matrices. This continuous formulation is not
compatible with noisy discrete data and the following difference equation can
be assumed if we sample at $t=kT$, $k=1,2,\dots$ and that the variables are
constant over the sample period.
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		x(kT + T) & = \mathbf{A}(\theta)x(kT) + \mathbf{B}(\theta)u(kT) + w(kT)\\
		y(kT) & = \mathbf{C}(\theta)x(kT) + v(kT)
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

The additional terms $w$ and $v$ are the process and measurement noise,
respectively, which are assumed to be white and Gaussian with zero mean and
known variance. In the analysis presented here we assume the process noise $w$
is zero.

We made use of the Matlab System Identification Toolbox for the identification
of the parameters $\theta$ in each run of this output error model structure.

Figure \ref{fig:exampleFit} shows example input and output data for a
single run with both steer torque and lateral force as inputs. Notice that the
identified model predicts the trajectory extremely well. Similar results are
found for the majority of the runs. The Whipple model predicts the trajectory
directions but the magnitudes are too large, meaning that for a given
trajectory, the Whipple model requires less torque than what was measured. The
extended Whipple model with the arm inertial effects does a better job than the
Whipple model, but still has some magnitude differences.
%
\section*{MODEL COMPARISON}
We use the identification procedure described in the previous section for a
collection of experiments ($n=368$) over a range of speeds between about 1 and
9 m/s.  Figure \ref{fig:coefficients} plots identified coefficients of the
dynamical equations of motion (i.e. the bottom two rows of the \(\mathbf{F}\)
and \(\mathbf{G}\) matrices) as a function of speed for each experiment
compared to both the Whipple and arm model predictions. From visual inspection
the $\ddot{\phi}$ equation seems to be better predicted by the two models. The
roll equation also seems to have less spread in the experimental data. For
example, the \(a_{\ddot{\phi}\delta}\) coefficient appears to be very tight and
the first principles models predict it very well. The constant, linear and
quadratic trends in the coefficients are not easily seen for most coefficients.
This is due to the high variability in the results of a large number of
repeated experiments at some speeds, more detailed regression models may be
able to reveal the true trends.

Figure \ref{fig:bode} gives another view of the resulting data. It is a
frequency response plot at the mean speed for a set of runs. The blue lines
give the mean and standard deviation of the magnitude and phase of the system
transfer function \(\frac{\phi}{T_\delta}(s)\). Even though the spread in the
identified parameters seems high in Figure \ref{fig:coefficients}, the Bode
plot shows that the identified system response is not as variable, especially
in magnitude.  It is also apparent that the experimental magnitude has a -5 to
-10 dB offset across the frequency range shown with respect to the Whipple
model. This correlates with the amplitude differences in the trajectories shown
in Fig. \ref{fig:exampleFit}. Notice that the arm model has little to no offset
between 2 and 10 rad/s, thus the better amplitude matching.

\section*{CONCLUSION}
We have shown that a fourth order structured state space model is adequate for
describing the motion of the bicycle under manual control in a speed range from
approximately 1.5 m/s to 8 m/s. The fact that higher order models may not be
necessary for bicycle dynamic description is an important finding, but the data
subsequently reveals that archetypal first principles models are not robust
enough to fully describe the dynamics. The deficiencies are most probably due
to the knife edge, no side slip wheel contact assumptions made in the two
models. The uncertainty in the estimates of the physical parameters is not
large enough to explain the difference between the coefficient identification
and their predictions from first principles. It is likely that tire scrub
torques of some sort are needed to improve the fidelity. Future work will
focus on identifying the process noise for better parameter estimation, fitting
regression models to the coefficient data, and adding simple tire scrub torque
extensions to the first principles model.
