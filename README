This is raw text and code for producing the plots for the DSCC/MOVIC 2012
conference.

The plots are produced explicity with the following software:

- NumPy 1.6.1
- SciPy 0.10.0
- matplotlib 1.0.1
- BicycleID debd089142e0d9e1bc2c448bbcfdab4060c08dc4
  https://github.com/moorepants/BicycleID
- DynamicistToolKit 44eedbc4624e28d93e0bcf75fbce43041da5e1cd
  https://github.com/moorepants/DynamicistToolKit
- Matlab: 7.10.0.499 (R2010a)

The data was generated using:

- BicycleDataProcessor (processed run data)
- BicycleSystemID (script to identify the models for each run)

The arm model data was generated manually from source code in my dissertation
(https://github.com/moorepants/dissertation).
